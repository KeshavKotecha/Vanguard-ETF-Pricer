A simple project to get started. 

I price some VANGUARD Australian ETF's on python. Scrape internet for PCF data, Use Yahoo finance live pricing and output live INAVS for select PCF's
To run, download main code and csv file (ASX300.csv). Import ASX300 into your project and then run the script

Feel free to reach out for any questions

All work is mine.
